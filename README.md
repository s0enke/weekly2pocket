# Login

[Full Tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/01-login)

This example shows how to implement ***Login*** and ***SignUp*** features to your ReactJS application using `auth0-lock` widget. It also shows how to setup react-router to require authentication for urls with restricted access.

## Getting Started

The library `auth0-lock` provides the user authentication, and we also have `src/utils/AuthService.js` class to wrap Lock Widget usage and manage the localStorage items.

In order to get start, run the three commands below. Make sure your `.env` file has the correct values from your auth0 account.

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# copy configuration and replace with your own
cp .env.example .env

# Run
npm start
```

The npm start command uses webpack to compile the application code and run a simple server for the development environment. It also keeps watching for file changes, updating the browser tab properly.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

## Important Snippets

### 1. AuthService handling lock login and localStorage

```javascript
/* ===== ./src/utils/AuthService.js ===== */
import Auth0Lock from 'auth0-lock'

export default class AuthService {
  constructor(clientId, domain) {
    // Configure Auth0
    this.lock = new Auth0Lock(clientId, domain, {})
    // Add callback for lock `authenticated` event
    this.lock.on('authenticated', this._doAuthentication.bind(this))
    // binds login functions to keep this context
    this.login = this.login.bind(this)
  }

  _doAuthentication(authResult){
    // Saves the user token
    this.setToken(authResult.idToken)
  }

  login() {
    // Call the show method to display the widget.
    this.lock.show()
  }

  loggedIn(){
    // Checks if there is a saved token and it's still valid
    return !!this.getToken()
  }

  setToken(idToken){
    // Saves user token to localStorage
    localStorage.setItem('id_token', idToken)
  }

  getToken(){
    // Retrieves the user token from localStorage
    return localStorage.getItem('id_token')
  }
}
```

### 2. Protecting routes with react-router

```javascript
/* ===== ./src/views/Main/routes.js ===== */
import React from 'react'
import {Route, IndexRedirect} from 'react-router'
import AuthService from 'utils/AuthService'
import Container from './Container'
import Home from './Home/Home'
import Login from './Login/Login'

const auth = new AuthService(__AUTH0_CLIENT_ID__, __AUTH0_DOMAIN__);

// onEnter callback to validate authentication in private routes
const requireAuth = (nextState, replace) => {
  if (!auth.loggedIn()) {
    replace({ pathname: '/login' })
  }
}

export const makeMainRoutes = () => {
  return (
    <Route path="/" component={Container} auth={auth}>
      <IndexRedirect to="/home" />
      <Route path="home" component={Home} onEnter={requireAuth} />
      <Route path="login" component={Login} />
    </Route>
  )
}

export default makeMainRoutes
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
